# LearnSphere

LearnSphere is an independent AI research lab founded by an education researcher

The lab explores how artificial intelligence can personalize learning, automate research, and democratize access to educational innovation.

At LearnSphere, I believe that learning and intelligence are deeply interconnected — that every dataset tells a story, and every model can shape how people learn.

My work spans predictive learning analytics, AI-driven recommendation systems, and RAG-based knowledge tools that empower independent researchers.

LearnSphere operates as a small in structure, but designed to scale ideas into global educational impact.
